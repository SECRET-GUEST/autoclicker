## Usage / features : 

- `Zoom` : You can use ctrl + /- or scroll to zoom the whole app

- `Windows` : You can resize the window by dragging the righ down side corner 




### :triangular_flag_on_post: Tables :

:small_red_triangle_down:	 `Save & load` : You can save and load script in file `.txt` that you can easily modify with a text editor.

:small_red_triangle_down:	 `Delay` : Set an amount of time to play the actions

:small_red_triangle: `Click | double click | move` : You have to position with the position button or set it manually . Move = move the mouse without clicking
 
:small_red_triangle: `Press` : Press the choosen key, then in text you can set also how much you would like to press that key.
 
:small_red_triangle: `Combo` : Make a combo until 5 keys pressed in the same time.
 
:small_red_triangle: `Scroll` : Positive value for upside, and downside for the negative one. You can also record the frame (don't forget to stop it).

:small_red_triangle: `Text` : Type a text without a limit of characters, but you will better do to use combo to copy paste big amounts from a text file.
 
:small_red_triangle: `Keywords` : for website like github asking you to press keys to add keywords, so you can put a list of words separate by coma (and comas only), then set another key you would like to use for new separator.

:small_red_triangle: `Wait` : just wait the delay time

:small_red_triangle_down:	`Time machine modulator` : Upgrade or downgrade all delays

:small_red_triangle_down:	 `Reach infinity` by ticking the checkbox, and `escape the loop` by pressing `F8` or simply choose the number of loop in the spinbox, you can do both but why would you do that ? 

:small_red_triangle_down:	`Nanosecond entropy injector` : Probably the reason why you are here, this feature can set a new random amount of time between each actions 1 sec = 100 frames.




### :black_flag: Recorder :

With this feature you can record and replay the action you made without using tables, then press `F8` key to stop the replay. Don't forget to reset all events before starting to record another loop ! 



### :white_flag: Overlay :

The **overlay** can **display an image** **front of all** where you can **click through** your windowed app or games, you can for example use the image to win a **pixel war**, this tool is also downloadable, separate from the autoclicker here : https://github.com/SECRET-GUEST/Layer-one

Once the **image** is set, you can change its **opacity** or use the configure section to **resize** the **picture** , or give it a **position** .

Here's a tutorial explaining different ways to run the files:

# For **MAC** & **Linux** users:

Since this script is designed for Windows users, you should probably first improve the code.

However, here is the procedure to run the script:

* :computer:: [MAC] - https://macosx-faq.com/how-to-run-python-script/
* :keyboard: [LINUX] - open a terminal, then `cd` to the script's directory and type:

```
python script.pyw

```
(where `script.pyw` is obviously the name of the file you've downloaded)

# :desktop_computer: For **Microsoft** users:

Most of the time you can find an MSI installer in [source forge](https://sourceforge.net/u/secret-guest/profile), or in latest relase here, but if you don't you can still watch this tutorial.

Because this script is made by PyInstaller, it could be detected as malware. (sorry, but I will not spend money to just be approved by "security" software/websites, you have the code, and here are possibilities to help you run it:

## :large_orange_diamond: 1. Run by simple click on `APPLICATION.exe`

The `.exe` file is a portable version created for Microsoft users with PyInstaller, allowing you to download and use this file alone, without any additional files.

If there is no `.exe` file available, it means that the application is stored in a directory, as a portable version is not provided. In this case, simply locate the `APP_NAME.exe` file within the directory and launch it with a single click. You can place the folder anywhere you like and create a shortcut to the executable file for easy access.

## :large_orange_diamond: 2. Run with Python

`Python script` is a directory with the original script for python 3.11.

In case you have a lower version, you may have to download module imported not included with your version. Just read the first lines of the script in Alexandria with a notepad or whatever to find what's missing.

If you would like to run with python **YOU WILL NEED THE IMAGE .png PLACED IN THE SAME DIRECTORY OF THE RUNNING SCRIPT**.

Also, you can add a `w` to the extension (like `script.pyw`). It means `windowed mode`, to launch the python script without the CMD, but it's still a common python file.

## :large_orange_diamond: 3. Compile the script by yourself

### :gear: Instructions :gear: 

To create your own executable from the python file, you will need to install pyinstaller and python.

Here are the steps you should follow:

   :small_red_triangle: Download python 3.11.1 

Don't forget to add it to your path with the installer or in variables environment (so reboot your PC after the installation), here is the link: 

:crossed_flags: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.1/python-3.11.1-amd64.exe :crossed_flags:

:small_red_triangle: Open your CMD as an administrator and type the following command:

```
python -m pip install pyinstaller
```

:small_red_triangle: You can now run it using a ruby `.spec` file by entering the following command in the project directory:

```bash
pyinstaller YOUR_FILE.spec
```
Normally, I place a blank.spec file in the "script" folder, if there isn't one let's watch over here:

:crossed_flags: [HOW TO MAKE AN EXECUTABLE FAST](https://github.com/SECRET-GUEST/tiny-scripts/tree/ALL/python/INSTALLER) :crossed_flags:

:small_red_triangle: You can also run it directly with your OS, type the following command, replacing the file paths with your own:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --icon="...YOUR PATH.../YOUR ICON.ico" --add-data "...YOUR PATH.../ico;ico" --noconsole test.py
```
#### Here are the explanations of the different options:



- `--onefile`: creates a single executable that includes all dependencies.

- `--icon=icon.ico`: specifies the icon to use for the executable (replace icon.ico with the path to your icon file).

- `--add-data "path/to/file;folder_name"`: adds external files required by the program. The path to the file and the name of the folder in which the file will be extracted should be separated by a semicolon `;`. You can add multiple files by separating them with semicolons.

- `script.py`: specifies the name of your Python script.

- `--noconsole`: hides the console when the executable is run.



Make sure to replace the snipped parts with the names of your files and folders. Also note that the path should be specified based on the operating system you are working on.

After running this command, you should have a single executable that includes all dependencies, external files, and a custom icon, and does not show the console when running.

Alternatively, you can also :

## :large_orange_diamond: 4. Create a batch file to run

- [ ] Create a text file

- [ ] In the text file type and write (and change/complete the path, first is for python, 2nd is for script.py):

```
C:\YOUR PATH TO PYTHON\python.exe" "C:\**YOUR PATH TO THE SCRIPT**\script.pyw"
```


If Python is in the path, you can just:

```
python "C:\**YOUR PATH TO THE SCRIPT**\script.pyw"
```

- [ ] Rename the `new_file.txt` to `script.bat` then just click on it, and it will run the program
